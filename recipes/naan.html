        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Naan is a popular Indian flatbread that is traditionally cooked in a tandoor (clay oven).

        <ul>
            <li><b>All-purpose flour:</b> 3 cups </li>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> 1 teaspoon </li>
            <li><b>Dry yeast:</b> 1 teaspoon </li>
            <li><b>Water:</b> 1 cup (warm = approximately 110째F or 43째C)</li>
            <li><b>Yogurt:</b> 1/4 cup plain</li>
            <li><b>Ghee or melted butter:</b> 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li><b>Baking powder:</b> 1/2 teaspoon</li>
            <li><b>Salt:</b> 1/2 teaspoon</li>
            <li><b>Optional toppings:</b> garlic, chopped cilantro, or nigella seeds (kalonji)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Activate the Yeast:</b> In a bowl, combine warm water and sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
                Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b> In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder.
                Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, and ghee.
                Mix the ingredients to form a soft dough.
                Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li><b>First Rise:</b> Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, 
                and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b> If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven and preheat 
                it to the highest temperature (usually around 500째F or 260째C).</li>
            <li><b>Divide and Shape:</b> Punch down the risen dough and divide it into golf ball-sized portions.
                Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten and shape it into an oval or round shape using a rolling pin.</li>
            <li><b>Optional Toppings:</b> If desired, you can brush the naan with melted butter and sprinkle chopped garlic, 
                cilantro, or nigella seeds on top.</li>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> Place the shaped naan on the preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet.
                Bake for 6-8 minutes, or until the naan puffs up and develops a slight char on top.</li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b>  Remove the naan from the oven and brush it with additional melted butter if desired.
                Serve the naan warm with your favorite Indian dishes, such as curry, dal, or kebabs.</li>
