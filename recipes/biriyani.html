        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken biryani is a complete meal in itself, enjoyed by people across different cultures. 
            It can be accompanied by raita (yogurt with spices), salad, or a side of curry.</p>
        
        <p>The regional variations in biryani recipes add to the diversity and richness of this beloved dish.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Chicken:</b> Typically, bone-in pieces of chicken, such as thighs or drumsticks, are used.</li>
            <li><b>Basmati Rice:</b> Long-grain basmati rice is preferred for its distinct aroma and fluffy texture.</li>
            <li><b>Spices:</b> A variety of spices are used, including cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaves.</li>
            <li><b>Yogurt:</b> It adds a creamy texture and helps in tenderizing the chicken.</li>
            <li><b>Onions:</b> Sliced onions are often caramelized to add sweetness and color.</li>
            <li><b>Tomatoes:</b> Tomatoes are used to add a tangy flavor to the dish.</li>
            <li><b>Ginger-Garlic Paste:</b> A paste made from fresh ginger and garlic adds depth to the flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Mint and Cilantro:</b> Fresh herbs are used to enhance the aroma and freshness of the biryani.</li>
            <li><b>Ghee or Oil:</b> Ghee (clarified butter) or oil is used for cooking and flavor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Marination:</b> The chicken pieces are marinated in a mixture of yogurt, 
                ginger-garlic paste, and a blend of spices. 
                This helps in infusing flavors and tenderizing the chicken.</li>
            <li><b>Rice Preparation:</b> The basmati rice is soaked, and then partially cooked. 
                This partially cooked rice is known as "parboiled" rice.</li>
            <li><b>Layering:</b> The biryani is assembled in layers. First, a layer of partially cooked rice is spread at the bottom of the cooking pot. 
                Then, marinated chicken is placed on top. This process is repeated to create layers.</li>
            <li><b>Caramelized Onions:</b> Sliced onions are caramelized until golden brown and crispy. These are used as a topping for the biryani.</li>
            <li><b>Dum Cooking:</b> The assembled biryani is then cooked in a sealed pot over low heat. This cooking technique, known as "dum" cooking, 
                allows the flavors to meld, and the chicken and rice to cook together slowly.</li>
            <li><b>Garnishing:</b> The biryani is often garnished with chopped mint and cilantro, and sometimes with fried onions and a drizzle of ghee.</li>
            
        </ol>
