        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Meat Mixture:</b> In a large mixing bowl, combine the minced meat with finely chopped onion, 
                minced garlic, grated ginger, chopped green chilies, fresh coriander, cumin powder, coriander powder, 
                garam masala, turmeric powder, and salt.
                Add a binding agent like bread crumbs or besan (gram flour) to hold the mixture together.</li>
            <li><b>Marination:</b> Add lemon juice or yogurt to the mixture. 
                This not only adds flavor but also helps in tenderizing the meat. 
                Allow it to marinate for at least 1-2 hours, or even overnight in the refrigerator for more flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Skewering:</b> Take portions of the marinated mixture and shape them onto skewers. 
                The traditional shape is long and cylindrical, resembling a sausage.</li>
            <li><b>Grilling:</b> Preheat your grill or oven. Brush the seekh kebabs with oil or ghee.
                Grill the kebabs until they are cooked through and have a nice char on the outside. 
                You can also cook them in a pan on the stovetop.</li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b> Garnish with fresh coriander and serve hot with mint chutney, tamarind sauce, or a side of naan or rice.</li>
